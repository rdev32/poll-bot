# Michael Levins: News & Polls Reporter!

For querying quick polls on your server

## Usage
Use the `/poll` command in chat for creating a new poll
- Use the `question` attribute to ask your chat about something
- The `total` attribute is the number of alternatives you'll provide
- With the `option(Number)` you write the sentence you want to show as an option

The bot will show an embedded message with all the alternatives.

## Testing

For now the bot is reserved for internal use in servers. But will be deployed to general public soon!
