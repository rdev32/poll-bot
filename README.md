# Michael Levins: News & Polls Reporter!
For querying quick polls on your discord server

## Usage
Use the `/poll` command in chat for creating a new poll
- The `timeout` parameter specifies how much will your poll last
- Use the `question` attribute to ask your chat about something
- The `total` attribute is the number of alternatives you'll provide
- With the `option(Number)` you write the sentence you want to show as an option

The bot will show an embedded message with all the alternatives.
